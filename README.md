BlackBerry 10 Cascades: HowTo hide ActionBar and TitleBar after some seconds of Inactivity

This is a small project to demonstrate how you can hide the ActionBar and more by magic after a given time of inactivity.
There's also a Feature Request Issue for BB10 Beta 2: [Issue Tracker BBTEN-196](https://www.blackberry.com/jira/browse/BBTEN-196)
The Code for this snippet was inspired by gbeukeboom.
